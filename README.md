# Concurrency Assignment
## What is this?
This is a university assignment where I was tasked with creating two traffic light systems using multthreading and ports. More specifically, I had to implement a form of Distributed Mutual Exclusion algorithm for the basic part of the task where traffic lights are 'smarter' and hand the token firectly to each other.

The advanced task implemented uses 'dumber' traffic lights that are managed by a controller class that manages the distribution of the token.
# What mark did you get for this?
for this assignment I scored 93% which I was very happy with.
